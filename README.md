# Scrappy Opensearch

I’m no expert in opensearch nor would I become one by the end of this. The goal here is to understand opensearch’s sub-problems and solutions, build my own scrappy version of the solutions.

I'll be publishing the learning in this Medium Publication - https://medium.com/building-opensearch-from-scratch-for-fun
